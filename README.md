# Neurai Microcontroller Examples

A collection of example projects demonstrating how to integrate ESP32 and RISC-V microcontrollers with the Neurai network. These examples cover a range of use cases, including secure device validation, mesh networking, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and remote activation via blockchain-based tokens.

---

## Overview

This repository provides modular, ready-to-build code examples for two classes of microcontrollers:

- **ESP32**: High-performance WiFi & Bluetooth SoC  
- **RISC-V**: Open-source instruction set architecture platforms

Each example shows how to interact with the Neurai blockchain network via JSON-RPC endpoints, smart-contract calls, and token-based logic. The goal is to illustrate general design patterns, best practices for secure communication, and token-driven device control.

## Features

- **JSON-RPC Integration**  
  Perform secure HTTPS POST requests to Neurai RPC endpoints and parse responses with minimal dependencies.  

- **Blockchain-Based Device Validation**  
  Use on-chain state to register and authenticate microcontrollers.  

- **Mesh Networking**  
  Establish peer-to-peer overlays authenticated by blockchain identities.  

- **Asset Tokenization (RWA)**  
  Map physical or digital assets to ERC-20 or custom tokens and track ownership.  

- **Remote Activation & Control**  
  Trigger device actions (e.g., power on/off, configuration changes) via specific token transfers or smart-contract events.

## Example Use Cases

1. **ESP32 Device Validation**  
   - Query on-chain registry to confirm that an ESP32 module is authorized to join the network.  
   - Reject or limit access if validation fails.  

2. **Blockchain-Backed Mesh Networks**  
   - Implement a lightweight mesh protocol where each node validates neighbors’ identities on the Neurai chain before forwarding traffic.  

3. **RWA Token Assignment**  
   - Assign real-world assets (e.g., industrial machines, sensors) to on-chain tokens.  
   - Track transfers of ownership and escrow mechanisms.  

4. **Remote Device Activation**  
   - Monitor token balances or events (e.g., a specific “activation” token) and remotely switch peripherals or relays.  
   - Integrate with hardware control libraries for GPIO, PWM, etc.
